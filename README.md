# Klein Bottle

This repository contains an OpenSCAD implementation of a Klein Bottle.

I found the parameterisation of the classic form at:

https://mathcurve.com/surfaces.gb/klein/klein.shtml

The given parameterisation consusts of two parts, for the top and bottom part of the bottle.

Due to an issue with OpenSCAD v2021.01, both halves cannot be rendered at the same time, but must be rendered individually.

I used Meshmixer to put the two halves of the bottle together.
